I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the ECE department at UC San Diego, where I work with Prof. Dinesh Bharadia in the Wireless Communication, Sensing and Networking Group ([WCSNG](https://wcsng.ucsd.edu/)).

Prior to UCSD, I received my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from University of Tehran.

My research interests lie in the span of deep learning, wireless communication, and optimization.
